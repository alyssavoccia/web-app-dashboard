# Web App Dashboard

This is the seventh project I completed for the Frontend Techdegree program from Treehouse. It is a responsive and interactive dashboard, created using CSS Grid and JavaScript. Users are able to simulate seeing notifications, tabbing through different chart options, and various forms.
